## Training Insights

### What's Working Well
1. **Collision Avoidance:** Perfect across all checkpoints
2. **Collaboration Improvement:** Steady upward trend (+55% from 200M to 280M)
3. **Time Efficiency:** General improvement in finish times with training
4. **Stable Performance:** Average success rate maintains ~31-32% through late training

### Areas of Concern
1. **High Variance:** Success rate varies 28-35%, suggesting instability
2. **No Clear Convergence:** Performance doesn't monotonically improve
3. **Mid-Training Dip:** 220M-230M shows performance degradation
4. **Success Rate Plateau:** Limited improvement after 240M

### Recommendations for Continued Training

1. **Continue Training Beyond 280M**
   - Collaboration degree still improving
   - May reach better local optimum
   - Target: 350-400M steps

2. **Consider Checkpoint 240M for Current Use**
   - Best success rate achieved
   - Good balance of all metrics
   - Use as baseline for comparison

3. **Investigate 220M-230M Dip**
   - Possible learning rate issue
   - May indicate hyperparameter adjustment needed
   - Review training logs for this period

4. **Monitor for Overfitting**
   - If success rate starts declining significantly
   - Watch collaboration vs success rate trade-off
   - Consider ensemble of 210M, 240M, 260M

## Conclusion

The Run 6 training has produced several viable checkpoints, with **240M showing the best success rate** (35%) and **280M demonstrating superior collaboration** (0.197). The zero collision rate across all checkpoints indicates robust obstacle avoidance learning.

However, the **high variance in success rates** and **lack of monotonic improvement** suggest that:
1. Training has not fully converged
2. Continued training beyond 280M may yield better results
3. The task remains challenging even for well-trained models

**Recommended checkpoint for deployment:** **240M** for its balanced performance across all metrics.

**Recommended action:** Continue training to 350-400M steps while monitoring for further improvements in collaboration and success rate stabilization.
